# Extension Methods

This repo contains the source for the `LeeConlin.ExtensionMethods` nuget package.

Master branch: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/v6hm7m45f9nyl9ib/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hades200082/leeconlin-extensionmethods/branch/master)

## Installation with NuGet Package Manager

```bash
Install-Package LeeConlin.ExtensionMethods
```

## Documentation

I've taken pains to ensure that the extension methods are as self-documenting as possible, including as much information in the XML-Doc comments (for intellisense) as possible.

To see examples of usage, browse the source code in this repo, especially the `LeeConlin.ExtensionMethods.Tests` project.
